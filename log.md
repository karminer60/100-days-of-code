# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started the first Advent of Code challenge.

**Thoughts:** It has been a while since I last coded! I had to review some basic git commands but I was able to get back into it after looking up what those were. I mostly read the problem prompt and began brainstorming how to solve the problem.

### Day 2: December 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on first Advent of Code challenge.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with how to set up the code for the solution. I coded the solution using codesandbox.io and was unsure how to structure the solution. I ended up putting the input provided as part of the problem in the index page and making it a constant. I then worked on iterating over the lines of the document and looping over each line.

### Day 3: December 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Submitted first Advent of Code challenge.

**Thoughts** I was able to create a decent solution using the logic I mentioned in the previous day's thoughts section. I had to think through how to get the sum of all the values I got from iterating over the lines and each character in a line. I did not get the correct answer but I will continue to work on the problem!
