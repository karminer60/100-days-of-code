# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started the first Advent of Code challenge.

**Thoughts:** It has been a while since I last coded! I had to review some basic git commands but I was able to get back into it after looking up what those were.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
